1. A README file should be submitted, explaining your code structure; TODO
2. Valid compile.sh and simulate.sh scripts must be submitted; TODO
3. The submitted program compiles without errors and warnings; OBV
4. The program displays usage information if no input files are given; TODO
5. The program correctly performs parsing and validation of the input, including IN PROGRESS
(a) checking for valid/invalid tokens; TODO
(b) verifying formats and magnitudes of parameters’ values; TODO
(c) identifying missing parameters and wrong order; IN PROGRESS
(d) identifying experimentation directives; TODO
(e) distinguishing valid but unrealistic inputs and signalling these as warnings (e.g. disposal rate exceeds service rate, lorry capacity smaller than bin capacity, etc.). TODO
6. Your code must generate, schedule, and execute wasted disposal events correctly; DONE
7. Your program must produce valid and correctly formatted output; TODO
8. A suite of test input scripts must be submitted, demonstrating the level of testing you performed for Part 2; TODO
9. Your code should be appropriately commented; TODO
10. Your code must exhibit an easy to follow structure and re-usability. YES
